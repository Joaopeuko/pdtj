# PDTJ - (Python Docstring To Json)

This project was created to solve a personal need for a flexible and simple tool to retrieve all
Python docstrings and convert them into a JSON format. The tool's design provides flexibility to
customize the parsing and documentation process, making it easy to navigate through the codebase's structure and
documentation.

This project aims to provide a powerful tool for parsing and documenting Python code within a directory. The tool works
by recursively traversing a directory and identifying all Python files contained within it. It then extracts the
docstrings of these files, organizing them into a dictionary format that captures the structure and documentation of the
entire codebase. This dictionary is then written to a JSON file, making it easy to view and access the information
it contains.
Whether you're a software developer or a codebase maintainer,
this tool can help you gain a deeper understanding of your Python code and streamline the documentation
process.

Moreover, this tool aims to simplify the process of generating a documentation webpage by
using the JSON file. It provides a clear overview of the codebase's structure and documentation,
allowing users to quickly navigate through the code and understand its functionality.
The project is designed to be flexible and customizable, enabling users to tailor the parsing
and documentation process to their specific needs. With this tool, you can easily generate comprehensive
documentation for your Python codebase and share it with others.
